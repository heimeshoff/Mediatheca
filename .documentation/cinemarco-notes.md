### Beyond the Black Rainbow
**Rating:** 4/5

Die absichtlich vage und kryptisch gehaltene Handlung bei starker Betonung der so überwältigenden wie verstörenden Optik war beabsichtigt, da Cosmatos laut eigener Aussage einen Film machen wollte, der einer Erinnerung an einen heimlich gesehenen Film entspreche, der einen als Kind geängstigt hat, weil er eigentlich für eine ältere Altersgruppe gedacht war, so dass die eigene Erinnerung an den Film als Erwachsener hauptsächlich aus emotional stark nachwirkenden visuellen Filmbildern bestehe, während man sich an die Handlung, die man als Kind nicht verstanden hat, dagegen kaum erinnert

### Host
**Rating:** 5/5

"My friend Bonnie recommended this movie, so I watched it last night. I haven't been legit scared by a horror movie in YEARS, but Host really nailed it. It's creepy, unsettling, genuinely scary, and BRILLIANT. This is the first thing I've seen that was made post-Coronavirus, the first thing that is set in the fucked up world we're trapped in right now. It's only 56 minutes long, and every minute is just perfect. I love this movie, and I can't recommend it enough."

### The Act of Killing

Fritz and I just watched a movie that disturbed me deeply.

Trigger warning - real violence.

The Act of Killing is a documentary about a former Indonesian death squad, who got absolute creative control to reenact their real life mass killings. The butcher of medan recreates his former atrocities in a bone-chiling self reflective way, and his emotional journey from self-aggrandizing to confrontating his guilt is horrifying and also beautiful.
This movie shows you the absolute deepest and most disturbing parts of humanity.

Werner Herzog produced the spiritual successor to this movie, so whoever wants a second chance at feeling like we do now, Ping me

### Pantheon

Just finished Pantheon and am still bathing in emotions. This animated series from 2022 is a deep exploration of what it means to be human in an ever more digitalized world. The captivating premise of uploaded minds and how their perception of us and vice versa changes over time is beautifully embedded in a family drama with authentic characters, voiced by great actors.

Do not spoil yourself, season two in its conclusion takes you through very weird philosophical hoops, best to get your mind shaken up unspoiled ;)
