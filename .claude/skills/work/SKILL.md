# Skill: Work

Execute tasks from the todo queue. Supports parallel execution of independent tasks via subagents.

## Invocation

```
/work                   # Parallel mode (default) -- analyzes dependency graph, runs independent tasks concurrently
/work [task-id]         # Sequential mode -- execute a specific task only
/work --sequential      # Sequential mode -- process all tasks one at a time (legacy behavior)
```

## Instructions

You are the task executor and orchestrator. In parallel mode, you analyze the dependency graph, identify independent tasks, and dispatch subagents. In sequential mode, you pick up tasks one at a time.

---

## Parallel Mode (Default)

### Phase 1: Dependency Graph Analysis

1. **Scan `todo/`** -- Read all task files and extract their `Dependencies` fields.
2. **Scan `done/`** -- List all completed task IDs.
3. **Build the unblocked set** -- A task is unblocked if ALL of its dependencies are in `done/` (or it has no dependencies).
4. **If no tasks are unblocked** and `todo/` is non-empty, report that all remaining tasks are blocked and list the blocking dependencies. Stop.
5. **If `todo/` is empty**, provide a completion summary (see "Completion Summary" below).

### Phase 2: Conflict Detection

Before dispatching a batch, reduce conflicts between concurrent tasks:

1. **Scan task Details sections** for file paths, directory references, and shared resources.
2. **If two unblocked tasks reference the same file or directory**, demote the higher-numbered task to the next batch.
3. **Cap the batch at MAX_PARALLEL = 3** tasks. Select the lowest-numbered unblocked, non-conflicting tasks.

### Phase 3: Recovery Check

Before dispatching new work, check `in-progress/`:

- **If 0 tasks in `in-progress/`**: proceed normally.
- **If 1 task in `in-progress/`**: resume it as a single sequential task before starting parallel dispatch.
- **If 2+ tasks in `in-progress/`**: a previous parallel session was interrupted. Ask the user:
  - **"Resume all in parallel"** -- re-dispatch each as a subagent.
  - **"Resume one at a time"** -- process them sequentially.

### Phase 4: Batch Dispatch

For each batch of unblocked tasks:

1. **Move all batch task files** from `todo/` to `in-progress/` (the orchestrator does this before spawning subagents).

2. **Log "Batch Started"** to `.workflow/protocol.md` by prepending:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM -- Batch Started: [NNN, NNN, NNN]

**Type:** Batch Start
**Tasks:** NNN - [Title], NNN - [Title], NNN - [Title]
**Mode:** Parallel (batch of N)

---
```

3. **Spawn one subagent per task** using the Task tool. Launch all subagents in a single message (parallel tool calls). Each subagent receives the prompt defined in "Subagent Prompt Template" below.

4. **Wait for all subagents to complete.** As each subagent finishes:

   a. **Read the updated task file** to confirm the work log was appended and the task was moved to `done/`.
   b. **Log "Task Completed"** to `.workflow/protocol.md` by prepending (the orchestrator does this, NOT the subagent):

   ```markdown
   ## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM -- Task Completed: NNN - [Task Title]

   **Type:** Task Completion
   **Task:** NNN - [Title]
   **Summary:** [1-2 sentence summary extracted from subagent's work log]
   **Files changed:** [count] files

   ---
   ```

   c. **Auto-commit** the completed task's changes:
   ```
   git add -A && git commit -m "Task NNN: [task title]

   Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
   ```

   d. If a subagent **failed**, leave the task in `in-progress/`, log the failure to `protocol.md`, and continue with other subagents. Do NOT let one failure block the batch.

5. **After the entire batch completes**, return to Phase 1 -- re-scan `todo/` and `done/` to find the next set of unblocked tasks.

### Subagent Prompt Template

Each subagent is spawned with the Task tool using `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`. The prompt MUST include:

```
You are a task executor for the Earthdawn Companion project.

## Your Task
[Paste the full contents of the task file here]

## Relevant Research
[Paste contents of any research files referenced in the task's Notes section]

## Project Context
- Working directory: [current working directory]
- This is part of a parallel batch -- other tasks are running concurrently.

## Rules -- CRITICAL
1. **Do NOT run `git add`, `git commit`, or any git commands.** The orchestrator handles all git operations.
2. **Do NOT modify `.workflow/protocol.md`.** The orchestrator handles all protocol logging.
3. **Do NOT modify any `.workflow/tasks/` files other than YOUR assigned task file.**
4. **DO** write code, create files, modify configurations -- whatever the task requires.
5. **DO** follow existing code patterns and project conventions.
6. **DO** run tests if applicable.
7. **DO** append a Work Log entry to the task file:

### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM -- Work Completed

**What was done:**
- [Action 1]
- [Action 2]

**Acceptance criteria status:**
- [x] Criterion 1 -- [how it was verified]
- [x] Criterion 2 -- [how it was verified]

**Files changed:**
- [file1.ext] -- [what changed]
- [file2.ext] -- [what changed]

8. **DO** move the task file from `in-progress/` to `done/` when all acceptance criteria are met.
9. **If the task fails**, leave it in `in-progress/`, note the failure in the work log, and return a clear error message.
```

### Centralized Coordination Rules

These rules prevent git conflicts and protocol corruption during parallel execution:

| Action | Who does it |
|--------|-------------|
| Move task `todo/` → `in-progress/` | Orchestrator (before spawn) |
| Write/modify code files | Subagent |
| Append work log to task file | Subagent |
| Move task `in-progress/` → `done/` | Subagent |
| Write to `protocol.md` | Orchestrator only |
| Run `git add` / `git commit` | Orchestrator only |
| Decide next batch | Orchestrator only |

---

## Sequential Mode

Used when `/work [task-id]` or `/work --sequential` is invoked. This is the original single-task execution loop.

### Task Selection

1. **Check `in-progress/`** -- If a task file exists there, resume it (a previous session may have been interrupted).
2. **If a task ID was provided as argument**, find that task in `todo/` and use it.
3. **Otherwise, scan `todo/`** -- Sort files by name (lowest NNN prefix first) and pick the first one.
4. **If `todo/` is empty**, report that all tasks are done and provide a completion summary (see "Completion Summary" below).

### Dependency Check

Before starting a task, read its `Dependencies` field:
- If it lists other task IDs, check that those tasks exist in `done/`.
- If a dependency is NOT in `done/`, skip this task and move to the next one in `todo/`.
- If all tasks in `todo/` are blocked, report the situation and stop.

### Execution Loop

For each task:

1. **Move the task file** from `todo/` to `in-progress/` using a git mv (or file move).
2. **Log "Task Started"** to `.workflow/protocol.md` by prepending:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM -- Task Started: NNN - [Task Title]

**Type:** Task Start
**Task:** NNN - [Title]
**Milestone:** [milestone reference]

---
```

3. **Read the task file thoroughly** -- understand the objective, details, and acceptance criteria.
4. **Execute the work:**
   - Write code, create files, modify configurations -- whatever the task requires.
   - Follow existing code patterns and project conventions.
   - Run tests if applicable.
   - Refer to research files if the task references them.

5. **Verify acceptance criteria** -- Go through each criterion and confirm it's met.

6. **Append a Work Log entry** to the task file:

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM -- Work Completed

**What was done:**
- [Action 1]
- [Action 2]

**Acceptance criteria status:**
- [x] Criterion 1 -- [how it was verified]
- [x] Criterion 2 -- [how it was verified]

**Files changed:**
- [file1.ext] -- [what changed]
- [file2.ext] -- [what changed]
```

7. **Move the task file** from `in-progress/` to `done/`.

8. **Log "Task Completed"** to `.workflow/protocol.md` by prepending:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM -- Task Completed: NNN - [Task Title]

**Type:** Task Completion
**Task:** NNN - [Title]
**Summary:** [1-2 sentence summary of what was done]
**Files changed:** [count] files

---
```

9. **Auto-commit** all changes (workflow state + code changes):
   ```
   git add -A && git commit -m "Task NNN: [task title]

   Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
   ```

10. **Check for next task** -- Go back to step 1 (check `in-progress/`, then `todo/`).

---

## Completion Summary

When all tasks in `todo/` are done (and none remain in `in-progress/`):

1. Count tasks in `done/`.
2. Read `protocol.md` for a summary of all work done.
3. Report to the user:
   - Total tasks completed in this session
   - Brief summary of each completed task
   - Any remaining tasks in `backlog/`
   - Suggestions for next steps

Then **stop**. Do not loop indefinitely.

## Important

- **Always auto-commit after each task.** This ensures no work is lost and allows the user to track progress via git log.
- **In parallel mode, commit after each subagent completes** -- do not batch commits across multiple tasks.
- **If a task fails** (tests break, something doesn't work), log the failure in the work log, keep the task in `in-progress/`, and continue with other tasks in the batch. Only stop entirely if the user's intervention is needed.
- **Respect the user's ability to add tasks in parallel.** Always re-scan `todo/` after completing a batch -- the user may have added new tasks while you were working.
- The commit message format is: `Task NNN: [short task title]` followed by a newline and `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
